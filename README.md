# Ninjargon Script
Repository for the standarization and compilation of the Ninjargon Script, from the TV show LEGO Ninjago.


## There are two forms of Standard Ninjargon Texts:

  * Modern Ninjargon, the script which all texts in this repository are written in and the script used in all LEGO Ninjago episodes since Season 8, Sons of Garmadon.
  * Old Ninjargon, the script used to originally transcribe Ninjargon letters. It possesses many similarities to the Modern Ninjargon Alphabet, but the letter 'V' is changed and the letters that follow it are shifted from their present transcriptions.

## For a table to learn the Ninjargon Script, look at [Ninjargon Script](<https://github.com/SaharshSS/Ninjargon-Script/blob/main/Ninjargon%20Script.pdf/>)

## What is the Ninjargon Script?

  * The Ninjargon Script is an alphabet, defined by the Unicode Consortium as "A writing system in which both consonants and vowels are indicated." It has letters that corrolate to the 26 letters of the English Latin Alphabet, but it lacks ***cases***, i.e. there is no uppercase or lowercase in Standard Ninjargon. Save for this, it is a simple substitution cipher of the English language, and defaults to the American spelling of words.
  * The Ninjargon Script also has numbers representing the Arabic numbers 0-9. They can be arranged to form larger numbers much in the same way that Arabic Numerals are used in modern languages.
  * The Ninjargon Script has punctuation marks that are mostly quite similar to the English language. However, the @ symbol has been modified to fit the Ninjargon version of the letter 'A'.
  * The Ninjargon Script has 6 Symbols correlating to the 6 core elemental powers in LEGO Ninjago, **Fireüî•, Lightning üå©, Earth ü™®, Ice ‚ùÑ, Water üíß, and Energy üü¢**.

## Texts, Excerpts & Literature

  * There are two types of texts in this archive **Original Ninjargon Texts** and **Translated Texts**
     * **Original Ninjargon Texts** are texts that are either directly taken from the LEGO NINJAGO¬Æ television show or texts that pertain to the show and/or have an obvious origin in the NINJAGO¬Æ universe. As all of Ninjargon's phonology and most of it's vocabulary are identical to Standard American English, it is assumed that the original dub is used for these texts.
     * **Translated Texts**, as the name would suggest, are texts in any foreign language other than Ninjargon, that have been translated into the Ninjargon Script.
# Good luck on your journey with the Ninjargon language, and may you go ***"Wherever the wind takes you."***
